Lab 6
-----------
1. Unzip all files. 
2. In this lab you will use Hash data structure to store information from a certain data file (you figure it out) and time the code for spellCheckAll method.
3. You will perform two timing experiments, one with existing data structure (as such ) in the code and the other with hash data structure.
4. You will do this for both story files.  
5. Submit only the Java code you made changes to and the timing results in a text file (there should be 4 - two for each story file).
